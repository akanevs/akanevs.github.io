title: Project 1: Proximity Computations and Heatmap Visualizations 
---

**Description:**

Code loads in mta station and tech company latitude and longitude locations,
and computes a proximity matrix (inverse of distance) that relates the proximity
of each tech company to each subway station. The distance between each set of
latitude/longitude pairs is computed using the Haversine distance, which is the
distance between 2 latitude/longitude points along a great circle (assuming
that the Earth is perfectly spherical). A proximity score is then computed for
each station by finding the N closest stations for each tech company, and 
assigning those N stations weights based on their "closeness" (that sum up to 
1.0). Finally we add up all of the weights for the top N stations over all the
tech companies to come up with the final score. We then rank those stations by 
sorting them based on this "proximity" score.

Heat maps are generated using the gmaps module, which uses the Google Maps API.

Here is an example of a heat map based on the top tech 35 companies in NYC:
